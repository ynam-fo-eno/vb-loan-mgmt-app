# ACS 216-B PROJECT BY TMK (APRIL 2023)

## This is the most complex app I ever built in Visual Basic, during mid- March to early April.

## Features
    1. Allowed someone to register their details to a DB (Access at the time)
    2. Allowed one to confirm their details on the table.
    3. Allowed one to pick a loan of their choosing.
    4. Second last form has control for whether you'd be able to pay off some of the loan (sending you to the final form) or can't (reminding you to do so and exiting the app)
    5. Last form, when updated, generated a "Crystal Report" showing the pay-off progress.
    6. A registered user could go directly to the paying off form via the MDI Parent Form the six forms were placed in. 

## Shortcomings
    1. Since I was a dumb first-year, I did not bother to figure out how to secure data in the database, hence no hashing or encryption methods used for passwords and the like.
    2. There's an exception I faced while a user attempted to go to Form 6 directly as in Feature 6. Haven't bothered to check on it since.
    3. UI was dull. I've never really had an eye for UI, and hopefully that'll improve as I start my web dev and application building journey.

    Among  many others my ignorance and hubris will prevent me from seeing...
 
 ### NB:
    To make this work, you need to install any version of Visual Studio after 2017.
    If you can configure it to incorporate VCS so you can clone this project more easily (unlike me in first year) the better!
